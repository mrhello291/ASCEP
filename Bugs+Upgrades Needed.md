# I need to fix these things

- Wanna read about how I built it -> notion (use the readme files to build a notebook)
- Add a trading AI bot which checks all the signals incoming and adds rules and suggests us arbitrage goals and things like that
- Merge the charts and analysis section into one page
- For each fast moving trend in the side show an AI result too which shows avg increase or decrease
- For HFT dashboard get the meaning of everything put in.
- Fix the trading signals in HFT dashboard
- Make use of arbitrage opportunities in advanced features and show it by default
- Use advanced algorithms like Bellman ford to calculate arbritrage opportunaties. Similarly use best algorithms wherever possible
- Add actual forex price feeds (alpha vantage is slow, so I will remove it)
- Add crypto pairs from more sources like coinbase and add arbitration opportunities between crypto pairs (like BTCUSDT Binance to BTCUSDT Coinbase)


### Done

- Add CEP rule according to convenience
- in price feeds tab, fix the data sources. It seems to be bugged. Binance seems to give real data
- Remove the pie chart from live price chart in dashboard
- Make github repo public
- Fix the Current time UTC bug and the time frame has to be brought to the top corner freezed for every tab
